In\ncontrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in\na single pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit\ndata. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce,\nhigh-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a\nsynthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors\nexisting code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally\nsample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write\nprograms. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive\nprogram diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction\n+ program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we\ninstruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B\nparameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset,\ncomparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks.

It remains unclear whether they translate\nto the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further\ncomplicates model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind\ncurrent practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals\ndue to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics,\nand incompatibility with base models. In this work, we present HELMET (How to\nEvaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive\nbenchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories. We also\naddress many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to\n128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot\nprompting for robustly evaluating base models. Consequently, we demonstrate\nthat HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs.\nThrough a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks\nlike NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse\ncategories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each\nother; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models\nsignificantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context\nreasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased\nlengths.

However, the application of modern language models to\npsycholinguistic studies is complicated by the practice of using tokenization\nas an intermediate step in training a model. Doing so results in a language\nmodel over token strings rather than one over character strings. Vexingly,\nregions of interest are generally misaligned with these token strings. The\npaper argues that token-level language models should be (approximately)\nmarginalized into character-level language models before they are used in\npsycholinguistic studies to compute the surprisal of a region of interest;\nthen, the marginalized character-level language model can be used to compute\nthe surprisal of an arbitrary character substring, which we term a focal area,\nthat the experimenter may wish to use as a predictor.

Central to RLHF is learning\na reward function for scoring human preferences. Two main approaches for\nlearning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in\nRLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through\nmethods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that\nthe implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in\nthe limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned\npolicy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including\niterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the\nperformance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred\nand rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even\nthough DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less\neffectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain\ndistribution shifts.

Ideally,\nLLMs should provide informative responses while avoiding the disclosure of\nharmful or sensitive information. However, current alignment approaches, which\nrely heavily on refusal strategies, such as training models to completely\nreject harmful prompts or applying coarse filters are limited by their binary\nnature. These methods either fully deny access to information or grant it\nwithout sufficient nuance, leading to overly cautious responses or failures to\ndetect subtle harmful content. For example, LLMs may refuse to provide basic,\npublic information about medication due to misuse concerns. Moreover, these\nrefusal-based methods struggle to handle mixed-content scenarios and lack the\nability to adapt to context-dependent sensitivities, which can result in\nover-censorship of benign content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nHiddenGuard, a novel framework for fine-grained, safe generation in LLMs.\nHiddenGuard incorporates Prism (rePresentation Router for In-Stream\nModeration), which operates alongside the LLM to enable real-time, token-level\ndetection and redaction of harmful content by leveraging intermediate hidden\nstates. This fine-grained approach allows for more nuanced, context-aware\nmoderation, enabling the model to generate informative responses while\nselectively redacting or replacing sensitive information, rather than outright\nrefusal. We also contribute a comprehensive dataset with token-level\nfine-grained annotations of potentially harmful information across diverse\ncontexts.

To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration\nmethod using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only\nrequires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it\nsubstantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at\nleast $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to\nany LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking.\nExtensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop\nand multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms\nRankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach that\nintegrates social context-based features with news content features to enhance\nthe accuracy of fake news detection in under-resourced languages. We perform\nseveral experiments utilizing a variety of methodologies, including traditional\nmachine learning, neural networks, ensemble learning, and transfer learning.\nAssessment of the outcomes of the experiments shows that the ensemble learning\napproach has the highest accuracy, achieving a 0.99 F1 score. Additionally,\nwhen compared with monolingual models, the fine-tuned model with the target\nlanguage outperformed others, achieving a 0.94 F1 score. We analyze the\nfunctioning of the models, considering the important features that contribute\nto model performance, using explainable AI techniques.\n","authors":["Mesay Gemeda Yigezu","Melkamu Abay Mersha","Girma Yohannis Bade","Jugal Kalita","Olga Kolesnikova","Alexander Gelbukh"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02609v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10960v3","updated":"2024-10-03T15:48:45Z","published":"2024-07-15T17:55:42Z","title":"Fast Matrix Multiplications for Lookup Table-Quantized LLMs","summary":"  The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by memory\nbandwidth, where the primary bottleneck is the cost of transferring model\nparameters from the GPU's global memory to its registers. When coupled with\ncustom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only\nquantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory\nmovement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized\nLLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are\ncompressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform,\nlookup table (LUT) quantization. This paper describes FLUTE, a flexible lookup\ntable engine for LUT-quantized LLMs, which uses offline restructuring of the\nquantized weight matrix to minimize bit manipulations associated with\nunpacking, and vectorization and duplication of the lookup table to mitigate\nshared memory bandwidth constraints. At batch sizes < 32 and quantization group\nsize of 128 (typical in LLM inference), the FLUTE kernel can be 2-4x faster\nthan existing GEMM kernels. As an application of FLUTE, we explore a simple\nextension to lookup table-based NormalFloat quantization and apply it to\nquantize LLaMA3 to various configurations, obtaining competitive quantization\nperformance against strong baselines while obtaining an end-to-end throughput\nincrease of 1.5 to 2 times.\n","authors":["Han Guo","William Brandon","Radostin Cholakov","Jonathan Ragan-Kelley","Eric P.

Specifically,\nTCSinger proposes three primary modules: 1) the clustering style encoder\nemploys a clustering vector quantization model to stably condense style\ninformation into a compact latent space; 2) the Style and Duration Language\nModel (S\\&D-LM) concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration,\nwhich benefits both; 3) the style adaptive decoder uses a novel mel-style\nadaptive normalization method to generate singing voices with enhanced details.\nExperimental results show that TCSinger outperforms all baseline models in\nsynthesis quality, singer similarity, and style controllability across various\ntasks, including zero-shot style transfer, multi-level style control,\ncross-lingual style transfer, and speech-to-singing style transfer.

It is often done by tuning the\nmodel or inserting preset aligning prompts. Recently, representation\nengineering, a method which alters the model's behavior via changing its\nrepresentations post-training, was shown to be effective in aligning LLMs (Zou\net al., 2023a). Representation engineering yields gains in alignment oriented\ntasks such as resistance to adversarial attacks and reduction of social biases,\nbut was also shown to cause a decrease in the ability of the model to perform\nbasic tasks. In this paper we study the tradeoff between the increase in\nalignment and decrease in helpfulness of the model. We propose a theoretical\nframework which provides bounds for these two quantities, and demonstrate their\nrelevance empirically. First, we find that under the conditions of our\nframework, alignment can be guaranteed with representation engineering, and at\nthe same time that helpfulness is harmed in the process. Second, we show that\nhelpfulness is harmed quadratically with the norm of the representation\nengineering vector, while the alignment increases linearly with it, indicating\na regime in which it is efficient to use representation engineering. We\nvalidate our findings empirically, and chart the boundaries to the usefulness\nof representation engineering for alignment.\n","authors":["Yotam Wolf","Noam Wies","Dorin Shteyman","Binyamin Rothberg","Yoav Levine","Amnon Shashua"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16332v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17041v4","updated":"2024-10-03T13:31:39Z","published":"2023-11-28T18:53:06Z","title":"Eliciting In-Context Learning in Vision-Language Models for Videos\n  Through Curated Data Distributional Properties","summary":"  A major reason behind the recent success of large language models (LLMs) is\ntheir \\textit{in-context learning} capability, which makes it possible to\nrapidly adapt them to downstream text-based tasks by prompting them with a\nsmall number of relevant demonstrations.

Jailbreak attacks, which\nmanipulate LLMs into generating harmful content, pose significant challenges to\nthis balance. Existing defenses, such as prompt engineering and safety\nfine-tuning, often introduce computational overhead, increase inference\nlatency, and lack runtime flexibility. Moreover, overly restrictive safety\nmeasures can degrade model utility by causing refusals of benign queries. In\nthis paper, we introduce Jailbreak Antidote, a method that enables real-time\nadjustment of LLM safety preferences by manipulating a sparse subset of the\nmodel's internal states during inference. By shifting the model's hidden\nrepresentations along a safety direction with varying strengths, we achieve\nflexible control over the safety-utility balance without additional token\noverhead or inference delays. Our analysis reveals that safety-related\ninformation in LLMs is sparsely distributed; adjusting approximately 5% of the\ninternal state is as effective as modifying the entire state. Extensive\nexperiments on nine LLMs (ranging from 2 billion to 72 billion parameters),\nevaluated against ten jailbreak attack methods and compared with six defense\nstrategies, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

For neural LMs (e.g., Transformer-based), NTP\ndistribution is essentially a softmax-regularized dot product between an\nencoded input context (query) and fixed vocabulary representations (keys). In\nthis paper, we study the effect of the key distribution on the NTP\ndistribution, with a focus on whether the similarity between keys will trigger\nspurious correlations in NTP. Through knowledge-probing tasks, we show that in\nthe NTP distribution, the few top-ranked tokens are typically accurate.\nHowever, the middle-ranked prediction is highly biased towards the tokens that\nare distributionally (not necessarily semantically) similar to these top ones.\nFor instance, if \"P\" is predicted as the top-1 token, \"A\"-\"Z\" will all be\nranked high in NTP, no matter whether they can lead to correct decoding\nresults. This hurts the sampling diversity and makes the sampling of correct,\nlong-tail results hopeless and noisy. We attempt to alleviate this issue via a\nnovel in-context method that iteratively pushes the query representation away\nfrom explored regions.

Compared with\nexisting methods for personalized subject swapping, SwapAnything has three\nunique advantages: (1) precise control of arbitrary objects and parts rather\nthan the main subject, (2) more faithful preservation of context pixels, (3)\nbetter adaptation of the personalized concept to the image. First, we propose\ntargeted variable swapping to apply region control over latent feature maps and\nswap masked variables for faithful context preservation and initial semantic\nconcept swapping. Then, we introduce appearance adaptation, to seamlessly adapt\nthe semantic concept into the original image in terms of target location,\nshape, style, and content during the image generation process. Extensive\nresults on both human and automatic evaluation demonstrate significant\nimprovements of our approach over baseline methods on personalized swapping.\nFurthermore, SwapAnything shows its precise and faithful swapping abilities\nacross single object, multiple objects, partial object, and cross-domain\nswapping tasks.

We investigate a new scenario to\nconstruct 3D object detectors: learning from the predictions of a nearby unit\nthat is equipped with an accurate detector. For example, when a self-driving\ncar enters a new area, it may learn from other traffic participants whose\ndetectors have been optimized for that area. This setting is label-efficient,\nsensor-agnostic, and communication-efficient: nearby units only need to share\nthe predictions with the ego agent (e.g., car). Naively using the received\npredictions as ground-truths to train the detector for the ego car, however,\nleads to inferior performance. We systematically study the problem and identify\nviewpoint mismatches and mislocalization (due to synchronization and GPS\nerrors) as the main causes, which unavoidably result in false positives, false\nnegatives, and inaccurate pseudo labels. We propose a distance-based\ncurriculum, first learning from closer units with similar viewpoints and\nsubsequently improving the quality of other units' predictions via\nself-training.

However, challenges arise due to dynamic disturbances, e.g.,\nlight reflections and refraction from the random air-water interface, irregular\nliquid flow, and similar factors, which can lead to potential failures in\nperception and navigation systems. Traditional computer vision algorithms\nstruggle to differentiate between real and virtual image regions, significantly\ncomplicating tasks. A virtual image region is an apparent representation formed\nby the redirection of light rays, typically through reflection or refraction,\ncreating the illusion of an object's presence without its actual physical\nlocation. This work proposes a novel approach for segmentation on real and\nvirtual image regions, exploiting synthetic images combined with\ndomain-invariant information, a Motion Entropy Kernel, and Epipolar Geometric\nConsistency. Our segmentation network does not need to be re-trained if the\ndomain changes. We show this by deploying the same segmentation network in two\ndifferent domains: simulation and the real world.

However, direct\nself-supervised stereo matching paradigms based on photometric loss functions\nhave consistently struggled with performance issues due to the occlusion\nchallenge. The crux of the occlusion challenge lies in the fact that the\npositions of occluded pixels consistently align with the epipolar search\ndirection defined by the input stereo images, leading to persistent information\nloss and erroneous feedback at fixed locations during self-supervised training.\nIn this work, we propose a simple yet highly effective pseudo-stereo inputs\nstrategy to address the core occlusion challenge. This strategy decouples the\ninput and feedback images, compelling the network to probabilistically sample\ninformation from both sides of the occluding objects. As a result, the\npersistent lack of information in the aforementioned fixed occlusion areas is\nmitigated. Building upon this, we further address feedback conflicts and\noverfitting issues arising from the strategy.

Tumor cells at low concentrations remain undetectable, for\nexample, in the most frequent type of primary brain tumors, glioblastoma.\nDeep-learning-based approaches fail to estimate the complete tumor cell\ndistribution due to a lack of reliable training data.

In this survey, we categorize existing works\nbased on how conditions are integrated into the two fundamental components of\ndiffusion-based modeling, i.e., the denoising network and the sampling process.\nWe specifically highlight the underlying principles, advantages, and potential\nchallenges of various conditioning approaches in the training, re-purposing,\nand specialization stages to construct a desired denoising network. We also\nsummarize six mainstream conditioning mechanisms in the essential sampling\nprocess. All discussions are centered around popular applications. Finally, we\npinpoint some critical yet still open problems to be solved in the future and\nsuggest some possible solutions.

Despite this, most VLT benchmarks still\ndepend on succinct, human-annotated text descriptions for each video. These\ndescriptions often fall short in capturing the nuances of video content\ndynamics and lack stylistic variety in language, constrained by their uniform\nlevel of detail and a fixed annotation frequency. As a result, algorithms tend\nto default to a \"memorize the answer\" strategy, diverging from the core\nobjective of achieving a deeper understanding of video content. Fortunately,\nthe emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of\ndiverse text. This work utilizes LLMs to generate varied semantic annotations\n(in terms of text lengths and granularities) for representative SOT benchmarks,\nthereby establishing a novel multi-modal benchmark. Specifically, we (1)\npropose a new visual language tracking benchmark with diverse texts, named\nDTVLT, based on five prominent VLT and SOT benchmarks, including three\nsub-tasks: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance\ntracking.

Parameters with low importance scores are dropped, and\nthe remaining ones are rescaled to form the final merged model. We assessed our\napproach in diverse merging scenarios, including cross-task, cross-domain, and\ncross-training configurations, as well as out-of-domain generalization. The\nexperimental results reveal that our approach achieves substantial performance\nenhancements across multiple modalities, domains, model sizes, number of tasks,\nfine-tuning forms, and large language models, outperforming existing model\nmerging methods.

One of the key issues of plane\nsegmentation is how to design powerful features that can exactly distinguish\nadjacent planar patches. The quality of point feature directly determines the\naccuracy of roof plane segmentation. Most of existing approaches use\nhandcrafted features to extract roof planes. However, the abilities of these\nfeatures are relatively low, especially in boundary area. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a boundary-aware point clustering approach in Euclidean and\nembedding spaces constructed by a multi-task deep network for roof plane\nsegmentation. We design a three-branch network to predict semantic labels,\npoint offsets and extract deep embedding features. In the first branch, we\nclassify the input data as non-roof, boundary and plane points. In the second\nbranch, we predict point offsets for shifting each point toward its respective\ninstance center.

Therefore, we first group plane points into many\nclusters in the two spaces, and then we assign the rest boundary points to\ntheir closest clusters to generate final complete roof planes.

However, they may be limited in modeling large\ninter-subject variations in organ shapes and sizes and exploiting global\nlong-range contextual information. This is because CNNs typically employ\nconvolutions with fixed-sized local receptive fields and lack the mechanisms to\nutilize global information. To address these limitations, we developed Dynamic\nMulti-Resolution Convolution (DMRC) and Dynamic Multi-Scale Convolution (DMSC)\nmodules. Both modules enhance the representation capabilities of single\nconvolutions to capture varying scaled features and global contextual\ninformation. This is achieved in the DMRC module by employing a convolutional\nfilter on images with different resolutions and subsequently utilizing dynamic\nmechanisms to model global inter-dependencies between features. In contrast,\nthe DMSC module extracts features at different scales by employing convolutions\nwith different kernel sizes and utilizing dynamic mechanisms to extract global\ncontextual information. The utilization of convolutions with different kernel\nsizes in the DMSC module may increase computational complexity. To lessen this\nburden, we propose to use a lightweight design for convolution layers with a\nlarge kernel size. Thus, DMSC and DMRC modules are designed as lightweight\ndrop-in replacements for single convolutions, and they can be easily integrated\ninto general CNN architectures for end-to-end training. The segmentation\nnetwork was proposed by incorporating our DMSC and DMRC modules into a standard\nU-Net architecture, termed Dynamic Multi-scale and Multi-resolution Convolution\nnetwork (DMC-Net).

Image style transfer is also a widely researched\napplication of image-to-image translation, where the goal is to synthesize an\nimage that combines the content of one image with the style of another.\nExisting state-of-the-art methods often rely on complex neural networks,\nincluding diffusion models and language models, to achieve high-quality style\ntransfer, but these methods can be computationally expensive and intricate to\nimplement. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel shuffle method that\naddresses the image-to-image translation problem generally with a specific\ndemonstrative application in style transfer.

This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise\nvisual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual\nreasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics --\nimages composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web,\ndesign, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we\nenable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level\nreasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details,\nwe use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes.\nHowever, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To\ntackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which\nintroduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual\nrepresentation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of\nprimitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their\ncorresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data\nand represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics.\nThis abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by\nfoundation models for zero-shot generalization.

To reduce this bias, we propose Adversarial Instruction Tuning (AIT)\nthat robustly fine-tunes LVLMs against hallucinatory dialogues. Extensive\nexperiments show our proposed approach successfully reduces dialogue\nhallucination while maintaining performance.\n","authors":["Dongmin Park","Zhaofang Qian","Guangxing Han","Ser-Nam Lim"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10492v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04559v3","updated":"2024-10-03T18:02:07Z","published":"2024-07-05T14:48:15Z","title":"Not (yet) the whole story: Evaluating Visual Storytelling Requires More\n  than Measuring Coherence, Grounding, and Repetition","summary":"  Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a\ntemporally ordered sequence of images.

This issue is even wider when processing medical data, where a lack of\nmethodological standards causes large variations being provided by different\nimaging centers or acquired with various devices and cofactors. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable, data- and task-agnostic\nframework able to extract salient features from medical images. The proposed\nquaternion wavelet network (QUAVE) can be easily integrated with any\npre-existing medical image analysis or synthesis task, and it can be involved\nwith real, quaternion, or hypercomplex-valued models, generalizing their\nadoption to single-channel data. QUAVE first extracts different sub-bands\nthrough the quaternion wavelet transform, resulting in both\nlow-frequency/approximation bands and high-frequency/fine-grained features.\nThen, it weighs the most representative set of sub-bands to be involved as\ninput to any other neural model for image processing, replacing standard data\nsamples. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation comprising different\ndatasets, diverse image analysis, and synthesis tasks including reconstruction,\nsegmentation, and modality translation. We also evaluate QUAVE in combination\nwith both real and quaternion-valued models. Results demonstrate the\neffectiveness and the generalizability of the proposed framework that improves\nnetwork performance while being flexible to be adopted in manifold scenarios\nand robust to domain shifts.

Two main approaches for\nlearning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in\nRLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through\nmethods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that\nthe implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in\nthe limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned\npolicy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including\niterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the\nperformance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred\nand rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM.

Most existing MLC methods are based on\nthe assumption that the correlation of two labels in each label pair is\nsymmetric, which is violated in many real-world scenarios. Moreover, most\nexisting methods design learning processes associated with the number of\nlabels, which makes their computational complexity a bottleneck when scaling up\nto large-scale output space. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method\nnamed Scalable Label Distribution Learning (SLDL) for multi-label\nclassification which can describe different labels as distributions in a latent\nspace, where the label correlation is asymmetric and the dimension is\nindependent of the number of labels. Specifically, SLDL first converts labels\ninto continuous distributions within a low-dimensional latent space and\nleverages the asymmetric metric to establish the correlation between different\nlabels.

To understand why they perform so well and to assess their\nreliability, several studies have focused on questions such as: Which\nlinguistic properties are encoded by these models, and to what extent? How\nrobust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with\nperturbations in the input text? However, these studies have mainly focused on\nBERT and the English language. In this paper, we investigate similar questions\nregarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across\n13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual\nTransformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific). To conduct this study,\nwe introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing\napproximately $\\sim$47K sentences. Surprisingly, our probing analysis of\nsurface, syntactic, and semantic properties reveals that while almost all\nmultilingual models demonstrate consistent encoding performance for English,\nthey show mixed results for Indic languages. As expected, Indic-specific\nmultilingual models capture linguistic properties in Indic languages better\nthan universal models. Intriguingly, universal models broadly exhibit better\nrobustness compared to Indic-specific models, particularly under perturbations\nsuch as dropping both nouns and verbs, dropping only verbs, or keeping only\nnouns. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into probing and\nperturbation-specific strengths and weaknesses of popular multilingual\nTransformer-based models for different Indic languages.

When coupled with\ncustom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only\nquantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory\nmovement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized\nLLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are\ncompressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform,\nlookup table (LUT) quantization.

However, it remains a challenge due to the domain gap between\nhumans and robots. Moreover, it is difficult to extract useful information\nrepresenting the dynamic world from human videos, because of its noisy and\nmultimodal data structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to\ntackle these challenges, which leverages a unified discrete diffusion to\ncombine generative pre-training on human videos and policy fine-tuning on a\nsmall number of action-labeled robot videos.

Recently developed model\nmerging techniques enable the direct integration of multiple models, each\nfine-tuned for distinct tasks, into a single model. This strategy promotes\nmultitasking capabilities without requiring retraining on the original\ndatasets. However, existing methods fall short in addressing potential\nconflicts and complex correlations between tasks, especially in parameter-level\nadjustments, posing a challenge in effectively balancing parameter competition\nacross various tasks. This paper introduces an innovative technique named\nPCB-Merging (Parameter Competition Balancing), a lightweight and training-free\ntechnique that adjusts the coefficients of each parameter for effective model\nmerging. PCB-Merging employs intra-balancing to gauge parameter significance\nwithin individual tasks and inter-balancing to assess parameter similarities\nacross different tasks. Parameters with low importance scores are dropped, and\nthe remaining ones are rescaled to form the final merged model. We assessed our\napproach in diverse merging scenarios, including cross-task, cross-domain, and\ncross-training configurations, as well as out-of-domain generalization. The\nexperimental results reveal that our approach achieves substantial performance\nenhancements across multiple modalities, domains, model sizes, number of tasks,\nfine-tuning forms, and large language models, outperforming existing model\nmerging methods.

While past theoretical works studied failover\nrouting under static link failures, i.e., links which permanently and\nsimultaneously fail, real-world networks often face link flapping--dynamic down\nstates caused by, e.g., numerous short-lived software-related faults. Thus, in\nthis initial work, we re-investigate the resilience of failover routing against\nlink flapping, by categorizing link failures into static, semi-dynamic\n(removing the assumption that links fail simultaneously), and dynamic (removing\nthe assumption that links fail permanently) types, shedding light on the\ncapabilities and limitations of failover routing under these scenarios.\n  We show that $k$-edge-connected graphs exhibit $(k-1)$-resilient routing\nagainst dynamic failures for $k \\leq 5$.

However, the tight\nlatency requirement and high load variance of applications pose challenges to\nserving systems in achieving high GPU utilization. Due to the high costs of\nscheduling and preemption, today's systems generally use separate clusters to\nserve online and offline inference tasks, and dedicate GPUs for online\ninferences to avoid interference. This approach leads to underutilized GPUs\nbecause one must reserve enough GPU resources for the peak expected load, even\nif the average load is low.\n  This paper proposes to harvest stranded GPU resources for offline LLM\ninference tasks such as document summarization and LLM benchmarking.

A unified representation across various\nmodalities is particularly important for improving efficiency and performance.\nRecent binding methods, such as ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023), typically use\na fixed anchor modality to align multimodal data in the anchor modal embedding\nspace. In this paper, we mathematically analyze the fixed anchor binding\nmethods and uncover notable limitations: (1) over-reliance on the choice of the\nanchor modality, (2) failure to capture intra-modal information, and (3)\nfailure to account for inter-modal correlation among non-anchored modalities.\nTo address these limitations, we propose CentroBind, a simple yet powerful\napproach that eliminates the need for a fixed anchor; instead, it employs\ndynamically adjustable centroid-based anchors generated from all available\nmodalities, resulting in a balanced and rich representation space.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\nmodel-agnostic strategy, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU), for CLIP. DMU\nefficiently fine-tunes a series of CLIP models that capture different feature\nspaces, from a dense pre-trained CLIP checkpoint, sharing parameters except for\nthe Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These models can then be transformed into a\nCLIP-MoE with a larger model capacity, leading to significantly enhanced\nperformance with minimal computational overhead. To the best of our knowledge,\nDiversified Multiplet Upcycling is the first approach to introduce sparsely\nactivated MoE into CLIP foundation models.

However, even state-of-the-art\nvision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level\nperformance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon\nplanning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Reflective Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test-time algorithm designed to enhance the\nability of AI agents, e.g., powered by GPT-4o, to explore decision space on the\nfly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive\nreflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically\nimprove their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate to provide\nreliable state evaluation. Moreover, we improve the agent's performance by\nfine-tuning GPT-4o through self-learning, using R-MCTS generated tree\ntraversals without any human-provided labels. On the challenging VisualWebArena\nbenchmark, our GPT-4o-based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative\nimprovement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art.\nAdditionally, we show that the knowledge gained from test-time search can be\neffectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. The fine-tuned GPT-4o\nmatches 97% of R-MCTS's performance while reducing compute usage by a factor of\nfour at test time. Furthermore, qualitative results reveal that the fine-tuned\nGPT-4o model demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a\nstate, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state\ncannot lead to success. Moreover, our work demonstrates the compute scaling\nproperties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time.\nThese results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' reasoning\nand planning capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and\nself-learning.\n","authors":["Xiao Yu","Baolin Peng","Vineeth Vajipey","Hao Cheng","Michel Galley","Jianfeng Gao","Zhou Yu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02052v1.pdf","comment":null}],"Multimedia":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01906v1","updated":"2024-10-02T18:05:03Z","published":"2024-10-02T18:05:03Z","title":"Social Media Authentication and Combating Deepfakes using Semi-fragile\n  Invisible Image Watermarking","summary":"  With the significant advances in deep generative models for image and video\nsynthesis, Deepfakes and manipulated media have raised severe societal\nconcerns. Conventional machine learning classifiers for deepfake detection\noften fail to cope with evolving deepfake generation technology and are\nsusceptible to adversarial attacks. Alternatively, invisible image watermarking\nis being researched as a proactive defense technique that allows media\nauthentication by verifying an invisible secret message embedded in the image\npixels. A handful of invisible image watermarking techniques introduced for\nmedia authentication have proven vulnerable to basic image processing\noperations and watermark removal attacks. In response, we have proposed a\nsemi-fragile image watermarking technique that embeds an invisible secret\nmessage into real images for media authentication. Our proposed watermarking\nframework is designed to be fragile to facial manipulations or tampering while\nbeing robust to benign image-processing operations and watermark removal\nattacks. This is facilitated through a unique architecture of our proposed\ntechnique consisting of critic and adversarial networks that enforce high image\nquality and resiliency to watermark removal efforts, respectively, along with\nthe backbone encoder-decoder and the discriminator networks. Thorough\nexperimental investigations on SOTA facial Deepfake datasets demonstrate that\nour proposed model can embed a $64$-bit secret as an imperceptible image\nwatermark that can be recovered with a high-bit recovery accuracy when benign\nimage processing operations are applied while being non-recoverable when unseen\nDeepfake manipulations are applied.

Point Cloud has become a popular\nvolumetric video format. A dense point cloud consumes much higher bandwidth\nthan a 2D/360 degree video frame. User Field of View (FoV) is more dynamic with\n6-DoF movement than 3-DoF movement. To save bandwidth, FoV-adaptive streaming\npredicts a user's FoV and only downloads point cloud data falling in the\npredicted FoV. However, it is vulnerable to FoV prediction errors, which can be\nsignificant when a long buffer is utilized for smoothed streaming. In this\nwork, we propose a multi-round progressive refinement framework for point cloud\nvideo streaming. Instead of sequentially downloading point cloud frames, our\nsolution simultaneously downloads/patches multiple frames falling into a\nsliding time-window, leveraging the inherent scalability of octree-based\npoint-cloud coding. The optimal rate allocation among all tiles of active\nframes are solved analytically using the heterogeneous tile rate-quality\nfunctions calibrated by the predicted user FoV. Multi-frame\ndownloading/patching simultaneously takes advantage of the streaming smoothness\nresulting from long buffer and the FoV prediction accuracy at short buffer\nlength.

Then, we propose a novel attack\nmethod, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious\ncontent designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our\nwork instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments.\nWe collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic\nwebsites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most\ncapable generalist web agent frameworks to date.

Textual\nreasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math,\nlogics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply\nscaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code\nInterpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated\nremarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve\ncomplex tasks using LLMs. However, based on our experiments on 7 existing\npopular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and\nmulti-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new\nO1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to\nwrite code when needed. We discover some interesting patterns on when models\nuse code vs. textual reasoning with the evolution to task complexity and model\nsizes, which even result in an astonishingly inverse scaling law. We also\ndiscover that results from LLM written code are not always better than using\ntextual reasoning, even if the task could be solved through code. To mitigate\nthe above issues, we propose three methods to better steer LLM code/text\ngeneration and achieve a notable improvement.

We find that LLMs display strong translation capability after being\nfine-tuned on as few as 32 parallel sentences and that fine-tuning on a single\ntranslation direction enables translation in multiple directions.

This occurs because modern LLMs often become\noverwhelmed by the vast amount of information in the context; when answering\nquestions, the model must identify and reason over relevant evidence sparsely\ndistributed throughout the text. To alleviate the challenge of long-context\nreasoning, we develop a retrieve-then-reason framework, enabling LLMs to reason\nover relevant evidence collected during an intermediate retrieval step. We find\nthat modern LLMs struggle to accurately retrieve relevant facts and instead,\noften hallucinate \"retrieved facts\", resulting in flawed reasoning and the\nproduction of incorrect answers.

We investigate a new scenario to\nconstruct 3D object detectors: learning from the predictions of a nearby unit\nthat is equipped with an accurate detector. For example, when a self-driving\ncar enters a new area, it may learn from other traffic participants whose\ndetectors have been optimized for that area. This setting is label-efficient,\nsensor-agnostic, and communication-efficient: nearby units only need to share\nthe predictions with the ego agent (e.g., car).

Third, going\nbeyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in\nmany-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than\nfull FT, using much fewer learnable parameters.

Furthermore, those metrics enable tasks such as image retrieval,\nobject recognition and quality assessment, essential in fields like healthcare,\nastronomy and surveillance. Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and\nFSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or\nsensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel\nimage similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being\nsensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel\nmetric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into\nvectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches.

For general inverse problems, approximations are\nneeded when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the\nmeasurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior\nsampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to\npreserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion\nprior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To\nenhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse\nproblems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad),\nwhich projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank\napproximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad,\nas a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to\nimprove the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and\nfilter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad\nimproves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of\nmeasurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case\nperformance.

To\nfacilitate the creation of the dataset, we propose a novel RGB2Thermal loss\nfunction, which enables the transfer of thermal style to RGB faces. By\nutilizing the Wasserstein distance between thermal and RGB patches and the\nstatistical analysis of clinical temperature distributions on faces, we ensure\nthat the generated thermal images closely resemble real samples. Using\nRGB2Thermal style transfer based on our RGB2Thermal loss function, we create\nthe T-FAKE dataset, a large-scale synthetic thermal dataset of faces.\nLeveraging our novel T-FAKE dataset, probabilistic landmark prediction, and\nlabel adaptation networks, we demonstrate significant improvements in landmark\ndetection methods on thermal images across different landmark conventions. Our\nmodels show excellent performance with both sparse 70-point landmarks and dense\n478-point landmark annotations.

Conventional approaches\nfor text-to-audio (TTA) tasks often make single-pass inferences from text\ndescriptions. While straightforward, this design struggles to produce\nhigh-quality audio when given complex text conditions. In our method, we\nutilize a pre-trained TTA diffusion network as the audio generation agent to\nwork in tandem with GPT-4, which decomposes the text condition into atomic,\nspecific instructions, and calls the agent for audio generation. Consequently,\nAudio-Agent generates high-quality audio that is closely aligned with the\nprovided text or video while also supporting variable-length generation. For\nvideo-to-audio (VTA) tasks, most existing methods require training a timestamp\ndetector to synchronize video events with generated audio, a process that can\nbe tedious and time-consuming. We propose a simpler approach by fine-tuning a\npre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), e.g., Gemma2-2B-it, to obtain both\nsemantic and temporal conditions to bridge video and audio modality.

To do so, we\nanalyse the role that temporal information plays on existing benchmark\ndatasets. We first estimate a baseline with temporally invariant models to see\nhow well such models rank on benchmark datasets (TVSum and SumMe).

However, their\nconsiderable inference costs impede practical deployment. The feature cache\nmechanism, which involves storing and retrieving redundant computations across\ntimesteps, holds promise for reducing per-step inference time in diffusion\nmodels. Most existing caching methods for DiT are manually designed. Although\nthe learning-based approach attempts to optimize strategies adaptively, it\nsuffers from discrepancies between training and inference, which hampers both\nthe performance and acceleration ratio. Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint\nthat these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep\nDisregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier\ntimesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align\npredicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate\nthe high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose\nHarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel\nlearning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT)\nand Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional\ntraining paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the\ndenoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior\ntimesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference.\nFurthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to\napproximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature.\nTherefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization,\nresolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage\non the predicted output at each timestep.\n","authors":["Yushi Huang","Zining Wang","Ruihao Gong","Jing Liu","Xinjie Zhang","Jun Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01723v2.pdf","comment":"Code will be released soon"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03290v1","updated":"2024-10-04T10:04:37Z","published":"2024-10-04T10:04:37Z","title":"Grounded-VideoLLM: Sharpening Fine-grained Temporal Grounding in Video\n  Large Language Models","summary":"  Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in coarse-grained video understanding, however, they struggle with\nfine-grained temporal grounding.

Recent developments allow for\ntext-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal\neffort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example,\ndiffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into\nthe original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case,\ntraditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper\nintroduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive\ncollection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image\nforgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF\ndataset includes approximately 75k forged images, originating from popular\nopen-source and commercial methods, namely SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. We\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods on TGIF. Whereas\ntraditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect\nregenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the\nregenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted\narea. Finally, both IFL and SID methods fail when exposed to stronger\ncompression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such\nas WEBP. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of\nstate-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern\ngenerative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable\nIFL and SID methods.

To\naddress these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's\nself-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we\nfirst show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline\nmodel-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling\nself-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls\nprey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the\ndata-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse,\nwhere learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior\nthat is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With\nGemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves\nstate-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models'\nself-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.\n","authors":["Aviral Kumar","Vincent Zhuang","Rishabh Agarwal","Yi Su","John D Co-Reyes","Avi Singh","Kate Baumli","Shariq Iqbal","Colton Bishop","Rebecca Roelofs","Lei M Zhang","Kay McKinney","Disha Shrivastava","Cosmin Paduraru","George Tucker","Doina Precup","Feryal Behbahani","Aleksandra Faust"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12917v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20974v3","updated":"2024-10-04T17:23:48Z","published":"2024-05-31T16:21:16Z","title":"SaySelf: Teaching LLMs to Express Confidence with Self-Reflective\n  Rationales","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate or fabricated\ninformation and generally fail to indicate their confidence, which limits their\nbroader applications. Previous work elicits confidence from LLMs by direct or\nself-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised\nfinetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the\ntraining-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level\nconfidence estimates. In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a training\nframework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidence\nestimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the\nprocess of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly\nidentify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This\nis achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in\nspecific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the\nanalysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the\nresulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize\nreinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate\nthe confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence\npredictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental\nresults in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and\nmaintaining the task performance.

Second,\nthough with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes\nand high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive\nbiases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity\nfor ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going\nbeyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in\nmany-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than\nfull FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we\ninvestigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to\ndistribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone).

This is particularly problematic in critical\ncontexts such as unlearning and alignment, where precise model evaluations are\ncrucial. To remedy this, we introduce the first formal probabilistic evaluation\nframework in LLMs. Namely, we derive novel metrics with high-probability\nguarantees concerning the output distribution of a model.

Through a case study focused on\nunlearning, we reveal that deterministic evaluations falsely indicate\nsuccessful unlearning, whereas our probabilistic evaluations demonstrate that\nmost if not all of the supposedly unlearned information remains accessible in\nthese models. Additionally, we propose a novel unlearning loss based on entropy\noptimization and adaptive temperature scaling, which significantly improves\nunlearning in probabilistic settings on recent benchmarks.

While only bag labels are\navailable for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and\ninstance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early\nMIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods\naccount for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have\nyielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of\nlocalization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been\ndesigned to target the classification task, while implications at the instance\nlevel have not been deeply investigated.

To enable TTA for regression, we adopt a feature\nalignment approach, which aligns the feature distributions between the source\nand target domains to mitigate the domain gap.

First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude\nof benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of\nmodel parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to\n144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B).

At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten\nif the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime\ncharacteristic of many modern LLMs. We then derive a simple theory of example\nforgetting via cumulative weight decay.

Recent developments allow for\ntext-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal\neffort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example,\ndiffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into\nthe original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case,\ntraditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper\nintroduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive\ncollection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image\nforgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF\ndataset includes approximately 75k forged images, originating from popular\nopen-source and commercial methods, namely SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. We\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods on TGIF. Whereas\ntraditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect\nregenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the\nregenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted\narea. Finally, both IFL and SID methods fail when exposed to stronger\ncompression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such\nas WEBP.

It ensures privacy by allowing clients to\ncollaboratively learn a shared global model while storing their data locally.\nHowever, a significant challenge arises when dealing with missing modalities in\nclients' datasets, where certain features or modalities are unavailable or\nincomplete, leading to heterogeneous data distribution. While previous studies\nhave addressed the issue of complete-modality missing, they fail to tackle\npartial-modality missing on account of severe heterogeneity among clients at an\ninstance level, where the pattern of missing data can vary significantly from\none sample to another. To tackle this challenge, this study proposes a novel\nframework named FedMAC, designed to address multi-modality missing under\nconditions of partial-modality missing in FL. Additionally, to avoid trivial\naggregation of multi-modal features, we introduce contrastive-based\nregularization to impose additional constraints on the latent representation\nspace. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedMAC across\nvarious client configurations with statistical heterogeneity, outperforming\nbaseline methods by up to 26% in severe missing scenarios, highlighting its\npotential as a solution for the challenge of partially missing modalities in\nfederated systems.\n","authors":["Manh Duong Nguyen","Trung Thanh Nguyen","Huy Hieu Pham","Trong Nghia Hoang","Phi Le Nguyen","Thanh Trung Huynh"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03070v1.pdf","comment":"The 22nd International Symposium on Network Computing and\n  Applications (NCA 2024)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03879v1","updated":"2024-10-04T19:22:35Z","published":"2024-10-04T19:22:35Z","title":"SONIQUE: Video Background Music Generation Using Unpaired Audio-Visual\n  Data","summary":"  We present SONIQUE, a model for generating background music tailored to video\ncontent.

Implementing new maintenance operations often necessitates\nmodifications in the DRAM interface, memory controller, and potentially other\nsystem components. Such modifications are only possible with a new DRAM\nstandard, which takes a long time to develop, likely leading to slow progress\nin the adoption of new architectural techniques in DRAM chips.\n  We propose a new low-cost DRAM architecture, Self-Managing DRAM (SMD), that\nenables autonomous in-DRAM maintenance operations by transferring the\nresponsibility for controlling maintenance operations from the memory\ncontroller to the SMD chip. To enable autonomous maintenance operations, we\nmake a single modification to the DRAM interface, such that an SMD chip rejects\nmemory controller accesses to DRAM regions under maintenance, while allowing\nmemory accesses to others. Thus, SMD enables 1) implementing new in-DRAM\nmaintenance mechanisms (or modifying existing ones) with no further changes in\nthe DRAM interface or other system components, and 2) overlapping the latency\nof a maintenance operation in one DRAM region with the latency of accessing\ndata in another.\n  We evaluate SMD and show that it 1) can be implemented without adding new\npins to the DDRx interface with low latency and area overhead, 2) achieves 4.1%\naverage speedup across 20 four-core memory-intensive workloads over a\nDDR4-based system/DRAM co-design technique that intelligently parallelizes\nmaintenance operations with memory accesses, and 3) guarantees forward progress\nfor rejected memory accesses.

To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$\ninference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that\ngenerates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference\npass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token\nembeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the\nlanguage model.

For all\nour target domains, we first adopt a segmentation model trained on the source\ndomain to create pseudo-labels. With these pseudo-labels, we train a\nconditional semantic diffusion probabilistic model to represent the target\ndomain distribution. Experimentally, we show that even with low quality\npseudo-labels, the diffusion model can still capture the conditional semantic\ninformation. Subsequently, we sample on the target domain with binary vessel\nmasks from the source domain to get paired data, i.e., target domain synthetic\nimages conditioned on the binary vessel map. Finally, we fine-tune the\npre-trained segmentation network using the synthetic paired data to mitigate\nthe domain gap.

However, in this\npaper, we raise questions about the overall significance of solving the phase\nordering problem in the first place, as pursuing a solution to this problem may\nnot align with the fundamental goal of compiler optimizations, i.e., generating\nthe globally optimal code among all programs that compilers deem semantically\nequivalent to an input program.\n  Our findings, supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence, show that\nsolving the phase ordering problem is not equivalent to generating such\nglobally optimal code. The fundamental reason that applying the optimal phase\nordering may still result in suboptimal code is the exclusion of programs of\nless efficiency during the optimization process. Motivated by this insight, we\npropose a theoretical approach, called \\textit{infinitive iterative\nbi-directional optimizations} (\\textit{IIBO}), which is guaranteed to converge\nto the globally optimal code for any input program.

Previous\nwork aiming to improve instruction-tuning performance often emphasizes the need\nfor higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, which typically\ninvolves expensive data filtering with proprietary LLMs or labor-intensive data\ngeneration by human annotators. However, these approaches do not fully leverage\nthe datasets' intrinsic properties, resulting in high computational and labor\ncosts, thereby limiting scalability and performance gains. In this paper, we\npropose SFTMix, a novel recipe that elevates instruction-tuning performance\nbeyond the conventional NTP paradigm, without the need for well-curated\ndatasets. Observing that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic\nrepresentation space, we argue that examples with different confidence levels\nshould play distinct roles during the instruction-tuning process. Based on this\ninsight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying\nconfidence levels, then applies a Mixup-based regularization to mitigate\noverfitting on confident examples while propagating supervision signals to\nimprove learning on relatively unconfident ones. This approach enables SFTMix\nto significantly outperform NTP across a wide range of instruction-following\nand healthcare domain-specific SFT tasks, demonstrating its adaptability to\ndiverse LLM families and scalability to datasets of any size.

This lack of randomization\nraises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In the\nfirst part, we review the literature on MIAs against LLMs. While most work\nfocuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, we show that a\nrange of target models, motivations and units of interest have been considered\nin the literature.

RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference\nshould maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated.\nSpecifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the\nrevised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms\ntraditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use\nLLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks.\nMore importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the\nclassical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional\nreferences and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also\nconducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of\ninference cost, and reference relevance.\n","authors":["Qiyuan Zhang","Yufei Wang","Tiezheng YU","Yuxin Jiang","Chuhan Wu","Liangyou Li","Yasheng Wang","Xin Jiang","Lifeng Shang","Ruiming Tang","Fuyuan Lyu","Chen Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05193v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05192v1","updated":"2024-10-07T16:49:39Z","published":"2024-10-07T16:49:39Z","title":"Understanding Warmup-Stable-Decay Learning Rates: A River Valley Loss\n  Landscape Perspective","summary":"  Training language models currently requires pre-determining a fixed compute\nbudget because the typical cosine learning rate schedule depends on the total\nnumber of steps. In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a\nconstant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in\nprinciple continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then,\ngiven any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper\nat any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model.\nEmpirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains\nelevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase.\nTowards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss\nexhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river\nat its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the\niterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it\nprogresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly\ndropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer\nto the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained\nhigh learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress\nin the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical.\nOur analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and\nshows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram\ndataset. Inspired by the theory, we introduce WSD-S, a variant of WSD that\nreuses previous checkpoints' decay phases and keeps only one main branch, where\nwe resume from a decayed checkpoint. WSD-S empirically outperforms WSD and\nCyclic-Cosine in obtaining multiple language model checkpoints across various\ncompute budgets in a single run for parameters scaling from 0.1B to 1.2B.\n","authors":["Kaiyue Wen","Zhiyuan Li","Jason Wang","David Hall","Percy Liang","Tengyu Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05192v1.pdf","comment":"45 pages,13 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02525v2","updated":"2024-10-07T16:46:05Z","published":"2024-10-03T14:33:34Z","title":"Contextual Document Embeddings","summary":"  Dense document embeddings are central to neural retrieval.

However, the limited\ncontext awareness of LLMs degrades their performance on RAG tasks. Existing\nmethods to enhance context awareness are often inefficient, incurring time or\nmemory overhead during inference, and many are tailored to specific position\nembeddings. In this paper, we propose Position-Embedding-Agnostic attention\nRe-weighting (PEAR), which enhances the context awareness of LLMs with zero\ninference overhead. Specifically, on a proxy task focused on context copying,\nwe first detect heads which suppress the models' context awareness thereby\ndiminishing RAG performance. To weaken the impact of these heads, we re-weight\ntheir outputs with learnable coefficients. The LLM (with frozen parameters) is\noptimized by adjusting these coefficients to minimize loss on the proxy task.\nAs a result, the coefficients are optimized to values less than one, thereby\nreducing their tendency to suppress RAG performance. During inference, the\noptimized coefficients are fixed to re-weight these heads, regardless of the\nspecific task at hand. Our proposed PEAR offers two major advantages over\nprevious approaches: (1) It introduces zero additional inference overhead in\nterms of memory usage or inference time, while outperforming competitive\nbaselines in accuracy and efficiency across various RAG tasks. (2) It is\nindependent of position embedding algorithms, ensuring broader applicability.\n","authors":["Tao Tan","Yining Qian","Ang Lv","Hongzhan Lin","Songhao Wu","Yongbo Wang","Feng Wang","Jingtong Wu","Xin Lu","Rui Yan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19745v2.pdf","comment":"preprint"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05052v1","updated":"2024-10-07T14:09:58Z","published":"2024-10-07T14:09:58Z","title":"Initialization of Large Language Models via Reparameterization to\n  Mitigate Loss Spikes","summary":"  Loss spikes, a phenomenon in which the loss value diverges suddenly, is a\nfundamental issue in the pre-training of large language models. This paper\nsupposes that the non-uniformity of the norm of the parameters is one of the\ncauses of loss spikes.

However, to meet these requirements\nin the Transformer model, the norm of the model parameters must be non-uniform,\nand thus, parameters whose norm is smaller are more sensitive to the parameter\nupdate. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique, weight scaling as\nreparameterization (WeSaR). WeSaR introduces a gate parameter per parameter\nmatrix and adjusts it to the value satisfying the requirements. Because of the\ngate parameter, WeSaR sets the norm of the original parameters uniformly, which\nresults in stable training.

However, SAEs are\nusually trained separately on each transformer layer, making it difficult to\nuse them to study how information flows across layers. To solve this problem,\nwe introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual\nstream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual\nstream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE\nlatents to `switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers.\nInterestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single\nlayer for a given token or prompt, but this layer may differ for different\ntokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over\nlayers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the\ndistributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of\nmagnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token.\nFor larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at\nmultiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual\nstream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar.

This work investigates the critical role of model\nscaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences\nbetween humans and models. We test three LLMs from different families (Bard,\n137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a\ngrammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding,\ncomparatives, and negative polarity. N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored\nfor accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated\npresentation of a prompt. Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are\ncompared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli.

Additionally, ChatGPT-4 wavers more than\nhumans in its answers (12.5% vs. 9.6% likelihood of an oscillating answer,\nrespectively). Thus, while increased model size may lead to better performance,\nLLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality the same way as humans are.\nIt seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue.

Specifically, the main contribution of this paper is\nidentifying and interpreting the Transformer length extrapolation problem as a\nresult of the limited expressiveness of the naive query and key dot product,\nand we successfully translate the length extrapolation issue into a\nwell-understood feature map processing problem. The novel insight, which can be\nadapted to various attention-related models, reveals that the current\nTransformer architecture has the potential for further evolution.

Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a\npracticable complement to LLMs, it relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved\ndocuments, raising concerns about how the model behaves if retrieval goes\nwrong. To this end, we propose the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(CRAG) to improve the robustness of generation. Specifically, a lightweight\nretrieval evaluator is designed to assess the overall quality of retrieved\ndocuments for a query, returning a confidence degree based on which different\nknowledge retrieval actions can be triggered. Since retrieval from static and\nlimited corpora can only return sub-optimal documents, large-scale web searches\nare utilized as an extension for augmenting the retrieval results. Besides, a\ndecompose-then-recompose algorithm is designed for retrieved documents to\nselectively focus on key information and filter out irrelevant information in\nthem. CRAG is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly coupled with various\nRAG-based approaches.

Despite recent advances in text-guided 3D scene editing,\nintegrating 2D VTON into these pipelines to achieve vivid 3D VTON remains\nchallenging. The reasons are twofold. First, text prompts cannot provide\nsufficient details in describing clothing. Second, 2D VTON results generated\nfrom different viewpoints of the same 3D scene lack coherence and spatial\nrelationships, hence frequently leading to appearance inconsistencies and\ngeometric distortions. To resolve these problems, we introduce an\nimage-prompted 3D VTON method (dubbed GS-VTON) which, by leveraging 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) as the 3D representation, enables the transfer of pre-trained\nknowledge from 2D VTON models to 3D while improving cross-view consistency.

However,\ncommonly used on-policy strategies are limited by the generalization capability\nof the reward model, while off-policy approaches require large amounts of\ndifficult-to-obtain paired human-annotated data, particularly in visual\ngeneration tasks. To address the limitations of both on- and off-policy RLHF,\nwe propose a preference optimization method that aligns DMs with preferences\nwithout relying on reward models or paired human-annotated data. Specifically,\nwe introduce a Semi-Policy Preference Optimization (SePPO) method. SePPO\nleverages previous checkpoints as reference models while using them to generate\non-policy reference samples, which replace \"losing images\" in preference pairs.\nThis approach allows us to optimize using only off-policy \"winning images.\"\nFurthermore, we design a strategy for reference model selection that expands\nthe exploration in the policy space. Notably, we do not simply treat reference\nsamples as negative examples for learning. Instead, we design an anchor-based\ncriterion to assess whether the reference samples are likely to be winning or\nlosing images, allowing the model to selectively learn from the generated\nreference samples. This approach mitigates performance degradation caused by\nthe uncertainty in reference sample quality. We validate SePPO across both\ntext-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks.

In this work, we empirically\nconfirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images\nare usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily\novershadowed by salient tokens. Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to\nrelabel the data with long captions, however, directly learning with which may\nlead to performance degradation in understanding short text (e.g., in the image\nclassification task). Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate\ndiverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its\noriginal level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability\nof long text understanding. We further look into whether the model can\ncontinuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between\nthe performance and the efficiency. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of\nour approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of\n100M long caption oriented text-image pairs.

However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness\nof their grounding capability.

In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for\nGUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly take\npixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can\naccurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their\ncoordinates on the GUI across different platforms.

In this paper, we find that editing\neither long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory\n(non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by\nretrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability,\ngeneralization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong\nediting settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will\ncause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor\nreliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can\nhardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor\ngeneralization).

To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nSelective Transformer (SFormer) for HSI classification. The SFormer is designed\nto dynamically select receptive fields for capturing both spatial and spectral\ncontextual information, while mitigating the impact of redundant data by\nprioritizing the most relevant features. This enables a highly accurate\nclassification of the land covers of the HSI. Specifically, a Kernel Selective\nTransformer Block (KSTB) is first utilized to dynamically select an appropriate\nreceptive field range to effectively extract spatial-spectral features.\nFurthermore, to capture the most crucial tokens, a Token Selective Transformer\nBlock (TSTB) is introduced, which selects the most relevant tokens based on the\nranking of attention scores for each query.

Given that\ntraining a 3DGS requires a significant amount of time and computational cost,\nit is crucial to protect the copyright, integrity, and privacy of such 3D\nassets. Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and\ncopyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks\nprofound exploration targeted at 3DGS. Unlike its predecessor NeRF, 3DGS\npossesses two distinct features: 1) explicit 3D representation; and 2)\nreal-time rendering speeds. These characteristics result in the 3DGS point\ncloud files being public and transparent, with each Gaussian point having a\nclear physical significance. Therefore, ensuring the security and fidelity of\nthe original 3D scene while embedding information into the 3DGS point cloud\nfiles is an extremely challenging task. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we\nfirst propose a steganography framework for 3DGS, dubbed GS-Hider, which can\nembed 3D scenes and images into original GS point clouds in an invisible manner\nand accurately extract the hidden messages. Specifically, we design a coupled\nsecured feature attribute to replace the original 3DGS's spherical harmonics\ncoefficients and then use a scene decoder and a message decoder to disentangle\nthe original RGB scene and the hidden message. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrated that the proposed GS-Hider can effectively conceal multimodal\nmessages without compromising rendering quality and possesses exceptional\nsecurity, robustness, capacity, and flexibility.

Additionally, the accuracy of AU detection is\nnegatively impacted by the class imbalance issue of each AU type, and the\npresence of noisy and false AU labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ncontrastive learning framework aimed for AU detection that incorporates both\nself-supervised and supervised signals, thereby enhancing the learning of\ndiscriminative features for accurate AU detection. To tackle the class\nimbalance issue, we employ a negative sample re-weighting strategy that adjusts\nthe step size of updating parameters for minority and majority class samples.\nMoreover, to address the challenges posed by noisy and false AU labels, we\nemploy a sampling technique that encompasses three distinct types of positive\nsample pairs.

Without a focusing lens, lensless\ncameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed\nmeasurements. However, current algorithms struggle with inaccurate forward\nimaging models and insufficient priors to reconstruct high-quality images. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage approach for\nconsistent and photorealistic lensless image reconstruction. The first stage of\nour approach ensures data consistency by focusing on accurately reconstructing\nthe low-frequency content with a spatially varying deconvolution method that\nadjusts to changes in the Point Spread Function (PSF) across the camera's field\nof view. The second stage enhances photorealism by incorporating a generative\nprior from pre-trained diffusion models. By conditioning on the low-frequency\ncontent retrieved in the first stage, the diffusion model effectively\nreconstructs the high-frequency details that are typically lost in the lensless\nimaging process, while also maintaining image fidelity.

In this paper, we provide the first attempt at a\ncomputationally efficient backdoor detection method to defend against\nbackdoored CLIP in the inference stage.

In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a\nconstant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in\nprinciple continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then,\ngiven any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper\nat any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model.\nEmpirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains\nelevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase.\nTowards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss\nexhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river\nat its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the\niterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it\nprogresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly\ndropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer\nto the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained\nhigh learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress\nin the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical.\nOur analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and\nshows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram\ndataset.

This variability can induce\ndistribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest\n$y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to\nmitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution\nshifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for\nEEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the\nRiemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is\nappealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper\nproposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift\nAdaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which\nsource domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic\nstructure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific\nre-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression\nmodel. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of\nage-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national\ndataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$\nhuman participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed\nthat GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression\nmetrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\\rho$) for several source-target site\ncombinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with\npredictive shifts in EEG data analysis. Our method has the potential to combine\nthe advantages of mixed-effects modeling with machine learning for biomedical\napplications of EEG, such as multicenter clinical trials.\n","authors":["Apolline Mellot","Antoine Collas","Sylvain Chevallier","Alexandre Gramfort","Denis A.

To solve this problem,\nwe introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual\nstream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual\nstream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE\nlatents to `switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers.\nInterestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single\nlayer for a given token or prompt, but this layer may differ for different\ntokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over\nlayers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the\ndistributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of\nmagnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token.\nFor larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at\nmultiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual\nstream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar.

In contrast, a vast amount of human videos exist, capturing\nintricate tasks and interactions with the physical world. Promising prospects\narise for utilizing actionless human videos for pre-training and transferring\nthe knowledge to facilitate robot policy learning through limited robot\ndemonstrations. However, it remains a challenge due to the domain gap between\nhumans and robots. Moreover, it is difficult to extract useful information\nrepresenting the dynamic world from human videos, because of its noisy and\nmultimodal data structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to\ntackle these challenges, which leverages a unified discrete diffusion to\ncombine generative pre-training on human videos and policy fine-tuning on a\nsmall number of action-labeled robot videos. We start by compressing both human\nand robot videos into unified video tokens.

In the fine-tuning stage, we\nharness the imagined future videos to guide low-level action learning with a\nlimited set of robot data.

Utilizing symbolic graphics\nprograms, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic\nreasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs\nprocedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in\ngeneral program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new\nlayer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer\ndifferent-grained semantic-level questions of the images or 3D geometries\nwithout a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs,\nLLMs would need to possess the ability to \"imagine\" and reason how the\ncorresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description.\nWe use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the\nsemantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally\nwith minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of\nimages that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing\nsignificant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and\nopen-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about\nvisual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning\ngenerally perform better.

We\nshow that this dynamic process in principle can converge to different stable\npoints, i.e. where the ML model and the Human+ML system have the same\nperformance. Some of these stable points are suboptimal with respect to the\nactual ground truth. As a proof of concept, we conduct an empirical user study\nwith 1,408 participants. In the study, humans solve instances of the knapsack\nproblem with the help of machine learning predictions of varying performance.\nThis is an ideal setting because we can identify the actual ground truth, and\nevaluate the performance of human decisions supported by ML recommendations.

Therefore, addressing\nthe AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) effectively becomes increasingly essential.\nThe AC-OPF, which is a fundamental optimization problem in power systems, must\nbe solved more frequently to ensure the safe and cost-effective operation of\npower systems. Due to its non-linear nature, AC-OPF is often solved in its\nlinearized form, despite inherent inaccuracies. Non-linear solvers, such as the\ninterior point method, are typically employed to solve the full OPF problem.\nHowever, these iterative methods may not converge for large systems and do not\nguarantee global optimality. This work explores a physics-informed graph neural\nnetwork, PINCO, to solve the AC-OPF. We demonstrate that this method provides\naccurate solutions in a fraction of the computational time when compared to the\nestablished non-linear programming solvers. Remarkably, PINCO generalizes\neffectively across a diverse set of loading conditions in the power system. We\nshow that our method can solve the AC-OPF without violating inequality\nconstraints.

A significant factor contributing to latency\nand energy is data transfers. One method to reduce transfers or data is reusing\ndata when multiple operations use the same data. Fused-layer accelerators reuse\ndata across operations in different layers by retaining intermediate data in\non-chip buffers, which has been shown to reduce energy consumption and latency.\nMoreover, the intermediate data is often tiled (i.e., broken into chunks) to\nreduce the on-chip buffer capacity required to reuse the data. Because on-chip\nbuffer capacity is frequently more limited than computation units, fused-layer\ndataflow accelerators may also recompute certain parts of the intermediate data\ninstead of retaining them in a buffer. Achieving efficient trade-offs between\non-chip buffer capacity, off-chip transfers, and recomputation requires\nsystematic exploration of the fused-layer dataflow design space. However, prior\nwork only explored a subset of the design space, and more efficient designs are\nleft unexplored.\n  In this work, we propose (1) a more extensive design space that has more\nchoices in terms of tiling, data retention, recomputation and, importantly,\nallows us to explore them in combination, (2) a taxonomy to systematically\nspecify designs, and (3) a model, LoopTree, to evaluate the latency, energy\nconsumption, buffer capacity requirements, and off-chip transfers of designs in\nthis design space. We validate our model against a representative set of prior\narchitectures, achieving a worst-case 4% error.

For lossless LLM\ndecoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising\nsolution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique\nchallenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct\ntoken sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more\nstringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM\nmust be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To\nalleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the\ndraft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to\nreduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named\nAtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K\nalignment under the strict top-K verification. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed\nsampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted\nsequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls. Correspondingly, we\npropose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification.\nEmpirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed\nsignificantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x\nspeedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed\nsampling verification.

Retrieval-Augmented\nICL methods try to address this problem by leveraging retrievers to extract\nsemantically related examples as demonstrations. While this approach yields\nmore accurate results, its robustness against various types of adversarial\nattacks, including perturbations on test samples, demonstrations, and retrieved\ndata, remains under-explored. Our study reveals that retrieval-augmented models\ncan enhance robustness against test sample attacks, outperforming vanilla ICL\nwith a 4.87% reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR); however, they exhibit\noverconfidence in the demonstrations, leading to a 2% increase in ASR for\ndemonstration attacks.

To fully utilize\nself-attention map, we present a deep experimental analysis on iteratively\nrefining cross-attention map with self-attention map, and propose an effective\niterative refinement framework for training-free segmentation, named iSeg. The\nproposed iSeg introduces an entropy-reduced self-attention module that utilizes\na gradient descent scheme to reduce the entropy of self-attention map, thereby\nsuppressing the weak responses corresponding to irrelevant global information.\nLeveraging the entropy-reduced self-attention module, our iSeg stably improves\nrefined cross-attention map with iterative refinement.

Experimental\nresults show that ReSocratic-29k significantly improves the performance of\nopen-source models.\n","authors":["Zhicheng Yang","Yiwei Wang","Yinya Huang","Zhijiang Guo","Wei Shi","Xiongwei Han","Liang Feng","Linqi Song","Xiaodan Liang","Jing Tang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09887v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04840v2","updated":"2024-10-08T16:14:43Z","published":"2024-10-07T08:54:23Z","title":"Strong Model Collapse","summary":"  Within the scaling laws paradigm, which underpins the training of large\nneural networks like ChatGPT and Llama, we consider a supervised regression\nsetting and establish the existance of a strong form of the model collapse\nphenomenon, a critical performance degradation due to synthetic data in the\ntraining corpus. Our results show that even the smallest fraction of synthetic\ndata (e.g., as little as 1\\% of the total training dataset) can still lead to\nmodel collapse: larger and larger training sets do not enhance performance. We\nfurther investigate whether increasing model size, an approach aligned with\ncurrent trends in training large language models, exacerbates or mitigates\nmodel collapse. In a simplified regime where neural networks are approximated\nvia random projections of tunable size, we both theoretically and empirically\nshow that larger models can amplify model collapse. Interestingly, our theory\nalso indicates that, beyond the interpolation threshold (which can be extremely\nhigh for very large datasets), larger models may mitigate the collapse,\nalthough they do not entirely prevent it. Our theoretical findings are\nempirically verified through experiments on language models and feed-forward\nneural networks for images.\n","authors":["Elvis Dohmatob","Yunzhen Feng","Arjun Subramonian","Julia Kempe"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04840v2.pdf","comment":null}]}}
